# Linear Equation Solver

This Python script solves systems of linear equations using matrix operations and Cramer's rule. It is designed to handle any number of equations and variables, provided they are equal in number.

## Features

- **Solve Systems of Linear Equations**: Computes solutions for systems of linear equations of the form:


- **Matrix Operations**: Uses the `numpy` library to handle matrix operations and determinants.
- **Singular Matrix Handling**: Alerts the user when the coefficient matrix is singular (determinant is zero), indicating no unique solution or infinite solutions.
- **User Input Validation**: Ensures valid integer and float inputs from the user.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `numpy` library

You can install the `numpy` library using pip if it is not already installed:

```bash
pip install numpy
```
